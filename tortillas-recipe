Ingredients:
  - 1 3/4 cups masa harina (recommend Maseca brand)
  - 1 pinch of salt
  - 1 1/8 cups hot water

Directions:
  1. Slowly combine masa harina and hot water until dough reaches consistency
     play-doh or smooth mashed potatoes. Should be firm but moist, not sticky
     or drippy. If it's still a little crumbly, add more water. It's good to
     start with less water - a drier tortilla will come out better than one that's
     too wet

  2. Cover dough with a wet towel and let sit for 45-60 minutes

  3. Preheat a griddle or skillet to medium-high heat

  4. Make a ping-pong-ball sized ball of dough and sandwich it between two pieces
     of plastic wrap or wax paper. Press dough ball with a tortilla press to
     desired thinness. If a tortilla press is not available, press dough with a
     wide, flat-bottomed plate or pan, then roll to desired thinness with a
     rolling pin or heavyglass bottle (i.e., wine bottle, olive oil, or
     something of that nature)

  5. After pressing the tortilla, carefully peel off the top layer of plastic or
     wax paper, and pick up the bottom piece. Then place the tortilla face-down
     in one hand and carefully peel off the plastic or wax paper with the other.
     Place tortilla immediately onto preheated griddle and cook for approximately
     30 seconds at a time on each side until it is browned and a little puffy.
     Do not cook for more than three minutes. Repeat steps 4. and 5. for each
     tortilla.

  6. You can cover cooked tortillas with a towel to keep them warm and moist
     until they are ready to serve.
